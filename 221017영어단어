Officials in Tennessee say at least 19 people are dead after two tornadoes
tore through the central part of the state early Tuesday morning.

The tornadoes prompt the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency to declare
a level three state of emergency.

Serveral school districts in the area announced their schools will be closed Tuesday.

The Associated Press(AP 통신) reports the storms destroyed dozens of buildings
in and around Nashville(지명).

Election officials in impacted areas have set up some alternative polling stations
for Tennessee's primary election, Tuesday.
