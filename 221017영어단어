Officials in Tennessee say at least 19 people are dead after two tornadoes
tore through the central part of the state early Tuesday morning.

Authorities in afftected areas are asking people to stay home...

... while they assess the damage and search for people who might be trapped under debris.

The tornadoes prompt the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency to declare
a level three state of emergency.

Serveral school districts in the area announced their schools will be closed Tuesday.

The Associated Press(AP 통신) reports the storms destroyed dozens of buildings
in and around Nashville(지명).

Election officials in impacted areas have set up some alternative polling stations
for Tennessee's primary election, Tuesday.

That's because some of the original polling sites are either without
power or were damaged.


The suspect in connection with shooting two New York City police officers in 12 hours has been
charged with attempted murder.

His past criminal history includes carjacking, a shooting with NYPD officers and attempted murder.

Robert Williams has also been charged with criminal weapon possession and resisting arrest.

Police allege he  ambushed  officers in an unmarked police vehicle, shooting an officer in the
chin and neck Saturday night.

Police say he then walked into the 41st Precint Sunday morning and opened fire, 
shooting a lieutenant in the arm.

LAX added three new lanes early Wednesday morning to accommodate more guests and vehicles.

LAX implement the new system, LAX-it, to reduce traffic, while its "Automated People Mover" train is
under construction.

But the system has created confusion and long wait times for rides.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Uber said it's "working with LAX to resolve some of the early
issues for riders who saw increased wait times during the first Sunday."

LAX added three new lanes early Wednesday morning to accommodate more guests and vehicles.


Travelers used to be able to walk out of LAX and have an Uber, Lyft, or taxi pick them up just
outside their terminal.

But under a new system, people have to walk or take a shuttle to a new pickup spot.
Travelers can still be dropped off at their terminal.

LAX implemented the new system, LAX-IT, to reduce traffic, while its "Automated People Mover"
train is under construction.

But the system has created confusion and long wait times for rides.

To put things into perspective: LAX is the fourth-busiest airport in the world and the second-busiest
in the U.S., according to Los Angeles World Airports.

Last year, 78.5 million passengers used LAX.

LAX apologized on its Twitter page last week to those who have "experienced an unacceptable level of service."

According to the Los Angeles Times, Uber said it's "working with LAX to resolve some of the early issues
for riders who saw increased wait times during the first Sunday."

Sunday nights are typically very busy for the airport.

LAX will use the new pickup system until it finishes building its train, which is scheduled to open in 2023.
