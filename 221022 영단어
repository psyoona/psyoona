A deadly coronavirus rapidly spread through mainland China has now killed
at least 132 people and infected more than 6,000 others.

This means there are officially more coronavirus patients in China than the number of people 
int the country who contracted SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome during the 2002-2003 outbreak.

That epidemic almost 20 years ago sickended over 5,300 people in the mainlan alone and killed hundreds
of people worldwide.

A number of countries are putting together plans to evacuate their citizens out of Wuhan, the Chinese
city at the center of the outbreak.

Some might have to travel by land. Multiple airlines across North America, Asia, and Europe have all
decided to suspend some of all of their flights to China.

A chartered flight carrying more than 200 Americans - including diplomats and their families - arrived
in Alaska Tuesday night before continuing onward to a U.S. military base in Southern California.

The passengers were all screended multiple times for symptoms of the coronavirus over the course
of the trip.

Because roughly 1,000 Americans live the Wuhan, the U.S. State Department said it's coming up
with additional evacuation plans.

Some might have to travel by land. Multiple airlines across North America, Asia, and Europe have all
decided to suspend some of all of their flights to China.

These decisions come after the CDC and the U.S. State Department urged Americans to avoid all
nonessential travel to China, because of the outbreak.
